**Thesis Questions**

* Why did you choose this data?
  * I was a Global Economics major and have always been interested in what makes a successful company. A large part of a companies image and how the public percives them is through their trademarks and products. Plus Lloyd didn't like my first idea and showed us Looker's public BQ project; Rufus took Iowa Liquour sales, so naturally I went the other way and took trademarks.

* What questions did you go in hoping to answer?
  * _see below_

* Show us something from your model. Maybe an interesting model structure or a tricky join
  * Self joins are interesting. The self join that we from owners to exam\_attorney_names will show us which exam attorneys are also owners of trademarks

* Highlight something you learned.
  * Scaling analytics is half the battle; scaling the knowledge about the analytics is what's next!
  * Drill baby drill!

* How did this change your understanding of our customers?
  * It helped my understand that customers who don't understand their data have every right. I wish they had more patience with the expectations that the DCL will have the answer right away, but also appreciate the customers who are willing to work with us and have a disucssion about it. It let's us ask the right questions to understand utlimate goals. Comprehending data and analysis reeals the truth and let's us really understand how a company can be successful.

* What questions do you have for the future?
  * What trademarks are more likely to be passed? Which of these industry dominators are the important features to inlclude when evaluating the likelynood of trademark registrations?
  * As a company how are we going to handle helping out customers scale their knowledge base?
    * Data dictionaries
    * Framework for "new customers" (this could be any user who is new to Looker even if their company is not)
      * This could include implementation plans and road maps
    * Development guidelines
    * Big picture ideas
      * Optimized query performance
      * Considered improving other part of the data pipeline
      * PDTs and when to use them
  * Do we fully understand the type data and best practice modeling techniques for it?
    * What data is relevant?
    * How can we bring in other data and modeling techniques to better support, drive, and scale customer's analytics?

**Initial Trademark Questions**

* Who dominates the trademark industry?
  * Owners?
  * Case Attorneys?
  * Exam Attorneys?
  * Classifications?
* How have the amount of total amount, total registered and renewed trademarks changed overtime?
* Where are the entities located and what is the filing location of the trademarks?
* What is happening with trademark transfers?
* What are the conversion rates of filed to registered trademarks from different entities?
* Which attorneys are also owners?
* Are there any outliers?

**Trademark Renewal Sections**

In 1965, the [trademark renewal laws](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/tmlaw.pdf) were amended which allowed trademark renewals.

In 1952, the basic structure of the modern Patent Law was laid out with the Patent Act of 1952. In this amendment, an inventor had to describe not only his invention but also the basis for its infringement. Furthermore, an invention needed to be new and useful, as well as non-obvious to be granted a patent. This amendment, which required patents to be non-obvious, was implemented to keep individuals from taking ownership or taking away from the base pool of knowledge in a particular field.

In 1982, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals was abolished, and patent cases were heard in the newly established Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit observed patents favorably and also started to provide more protection to their owners.

**International Trademarks**

The [Madrid system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_system) (officially the Madrid system for the international registration of marks) is the primary international system for facilitating the registration of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Its legal basis is the multilateral treaty Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks of 1891, as well as the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement (1989).

Even though there was an attempt in 1891 to establish an international trademark system, it was not achieved for two reasons:

* The lack of international acceptance
* The lack of national trademark systems

Thus, in 1989 the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement was brought to the table. Finally, with many ammendments and changes, in 1996 the Madrid Protocol was established. This Protocol is the modern international trademark system. This is the basis for why we start to see an large increase in international trademarks in 2005.

**Correspondent Trademark Attorneys**

In 1976, section 2.11 was ammended to [The Code of Federal Regulations of the United States of America](https://books.google.com/books?id=6vo6AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=were+there+trademark+case+attorneys+before+1970s?&source=bl&ots=GwxnEn7EhZ&sig=-fGlJzVbnUMURV1uLbgTy1wU_8M&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinj8ra6dbRAhXmiVQKHV9EDRQQ6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&q=were%20there%20trademark%20case%20attorneys%20before%201970s%3F&f=false), which allowed correspondent case attorneys to act on behalf of a trademeark owner.
