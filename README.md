**Trademark Renewal Sections**

In 1965, the [trademark renewal laws](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/tmlaw.pdf) were amended which allowed trademark renewals.

In 1952, the basic structure of the modern Patent Law was laid out with the Patent Act of 1952. In this amendment, an inventor had to describe not only his invention but also the basis for its infringement. Furthermore, an invention needed to be new and useful, as well as non-obvious to be granted a patent. This amendment, which required patents to be non-obvious, was implemented to keep individuals from taking ownership or taking away from the base pool of knowledge in a particular field.

In 1982, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals was abolished, and patent cases were heard in the newly established Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit observed patents favorably and also started to provide more protection to their owners.

**International Trademarks**

The [Madrid system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_system) (officially the Madrid system for the international registration of marks) is the primary international system for facilitating the registration of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Its legal basis is the multilateral treaty Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks of 1891, as well as the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement (1989).

Even though there was an attempt in 1891 to establish an international trademark system, it was not achieved for two reasons:

* The lack of international acceptance
* The lack of national trademark systems

Thus, in 1989 the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement was brought to the table. Finally, with many ammendments and changes, in 1996 the Madrid Protocol was established. This Protocol is the modern international trademark system. This is the basis for why we start to see an large increase in international trademarks in 2005.

**Correspondent Trademark Attorneys**

In 1976, section 2.11 was ammended to [The Code of Federal Regulations of the United States of America](https://books.google.com/books?id=6vo6AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=were+there+trademark+case+attorneys+before+1970s?&source=bl&ots=GwxnEn7EhZ&sig=-fGlJzVbnUMURV1uLbgTy1wU_8M&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinj8ra6dbRAhXmiVQKHV9EDRQQ6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&q=were%20there%20trademark%20case%20attorneys%20before%201970s%3F&f=false), which allowed correspondent case attorneys to act on behalf of a trademeark owner.
